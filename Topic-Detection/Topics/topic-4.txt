Acha, did you hear the audio notes I sent to Dhruva?
I forwarded you
I was asleep
I did. Vahi as you told me sab vhi tha jo humne itna discuss kr hi liya h.
Is there anything left to discuss on that? 
If not let's stop going back there naaa, please.
Don't want to go back either. Like at all.
Especially not with you
Because I can understand, its painful and more than redundant
But
Dhruva replied to me
Now that you've heard the audio
Iss reply ko padh
Maine kal padha tha
And I gave myself one full day to live with it, think about it
Just want your opinion on the same.
Opinion Matlab?
