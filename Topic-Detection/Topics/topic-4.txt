When people with COVID-19 breathe out or cough, they expel tiny droplets that contain the virus.These droplets can enter the mouth or nose of someone without the virus, causing an infection to occur.The most common way that this illness spreads is through close contact with someone who has the infection.I do not know, seems so low hanging. So low hanging.Droplets containing the virus can also land on nearby surfaces or objects.Other people can pick up the virus by touching these surfaces or objects.Infection is likely if the person then touches their nose, eyes, or mouth, so we all should avoid touching these parts of our body.But we do not need to panic.Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious, however, it can cause symptoms that become severe, leading to death in some cases.One report suggests that out of 1,099 people with confirmed cases in China, around 16% became severe.But another report estimates that about 3.6% of the confirmed cases in China led to death.These figures are likely to change as the situation evolves.However, they suggest that COVID-19 is more deadly than influenza. For example, seasonal influenza typically leads to death in less than 0.1% of cases.Still, the simplicity is attractive. Plus, I always wanted to do a GOTV experimentWhen testing becomes easier and more widespread, health experts will have a more accurate insight into the exact number of severe cases and deaths.Lets hope we overcome this pandemic soon enough.Yes, thank you for these great insights.Wow; that study you linked to is great.(Congrats on being so close!)YeahHey have do you know anything about fraud detection using the big data analytics techniques?Yes!In highly regulated sectors like financial, healthcare, insurance, retail, and social security, combating fraud is essential as there is a multitude of compliance, regulations, risk management measures, and monetary consequences to be dealt with.SweetIn a world where transactions and documents are digitally recorded in one way or another, evidence is out there to aid investigators in the battle against damaging fraudulent schemes.This looks awesome! Tell me more.Hey <@U16RAECF5>.Given the vast amount of data that our investigators need to sift through to find fraudulent patterns, an integrated big data and search architecture emerged as the most feasible approach.Public data, such as providers' information, codes for healthcare procedures, etc., is aggregated and processed through the big data framework, which performs massive denormalization to distribute data into multiple tables and fields.The processed data is then loaded into a search engine.
