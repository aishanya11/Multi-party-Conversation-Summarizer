Mental health aur lalit ke baare mein kaafi sahi realisations kiye maine

yaar I just love one day at a time. It has taught me so much and given me so much content that is and will continue to help me.
I cannot thank you enough for recommending it.

o rahi hai ho to talk to yourself, breathe and if that dosen't help, reach out
So that's why I texted you. I did this for the first time and I was not really sure about this, I have always hesitated sharing this stuff

Acha, did you hear the audio notes I sent to Dhruva?
I forwarded you
I was asleep
I did. Vahi as you told me sab vhi tha jo humne itna discuss kr hi liya h.
Is there anything left to discuss on that? 
If not let's stop going back there naaa, please.
Don't want to go back either. Like at all.
Especially not with you
Because I can understand, its painful and more than redundant
But
Dhruva replied to me
Now that you've heard the audio
Iss reply ko padh
Maine kal padha tha
And I gave myself one full day to live with it, think about it
Just want your opinion on the same.
