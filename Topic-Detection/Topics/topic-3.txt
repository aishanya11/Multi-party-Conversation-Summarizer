I do not know, seems so low hanging. So low hanging.Droplets containing the virus can also land on nearby surfaces or objects.Other people can pick up the virus by touching these surfaces or objects.Infection is likely if the person then touches their nose, eyes, or mouth, so we all should avoid touching these parts of our body.But we do not need to panic.
