SARS-CoV-2 spreads from person to person through close communities.
So it is not air borne, thats a relief.
Wow, I did not know that.
When people with COVID-19 breathe out or cough, they expel tiny droplets that contain the virus.
These droplets can enter the mouth or nose of someone without the virus, causing an infection to occur.
The most common way that this illness spreads is through close contact with someone who has the infection.
