Trump and Joe Biden are respectively the oldest and second-oldest major party presumptive presidential nominees in U.S. history;[b] and if either of them is elected and inaugurated, they will also become the oldest serving president presuming they serve out their term.I hope Trump loses. I cannot imagine Trump running America again, If that happenens, America is definetly doomed.Yep, I agree
