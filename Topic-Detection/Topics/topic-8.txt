Totally! I have a folder full of IRBs and you are welcome to any of them. I think that one that MR_WHITE has probably contains the sharpest language.
On helping people understand the value of experimental research: I've been thinking a lot about the push back that MR_WHITE and I got in designing a useful intervention. Today again I was talking to someone who has the opportunity to learn about a program's effectiveness, but instead is waving their hands talking nonsense. Has anyone seen a good attempt at explaining the value of experimental research to a non-technical audience?
