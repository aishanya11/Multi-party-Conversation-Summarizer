Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious, however, it can cause symptoms that become severe, leading to death in some cases.One report suggests that out of 1,099 people with confirmed cases in China, around 16% became severe.But another report estimates that about 3.6% of the confirmed cases in China led to death.These figures are likely to change as the situation evolves.However, they suggest that COVID-19 is more deadly than influenza. For example, seasonal influenza typically leads to death in less than 0.1% of cases.Still, the simplicity is attractive. Plus, I always wanted to do a GOTV experimentWhen testing becomes easier and more widespread, health experts will have a more accurate insight into the exact number of severe cases and deaths.
