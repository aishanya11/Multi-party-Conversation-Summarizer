Hey have do you know anything about fraud detection using the big data analytics techniques?Yes!In highly regulated sectors like financial, healthcare, insurance, retail, and social security, combating fraud is essential as there is a multitude of compliance, regulations, risk management measures, and monetary consequences to be dealt with.SweetIn a world where transactions and documents are digitally recorded in one way or another, evidence is out there to aid investigators in the battle against damaging fraudulent schemes.This looks awesome! Tell me more.Hey <@U16RAECF5>.Given the vast amount of data that our investigators need to sift through to find fraudulent patterns, an integrated big data and search architecture emerged as the most feasible approach.Public data, such as providers' information, codes for healthcare procedures, etc., is aggregated and processed through the big data framework, which performs massive denormalization to distribute data into multiple tables and fields.The processed data is then loaded into a search engine.
