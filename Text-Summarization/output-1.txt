Hey have anybody watched Atypical, on Netflix?Yeahh, Atypical is a coming-of-age television series created by Robia Rashid for Netflix, it focuses on the life of 18-year-old Sam Gardner (Keir Gilchrist), who has autism spectrum disorder.While Sam is on his funny yet emotional journey of self-discovery, the rest of his family must grapple with change in their own lives as they all struggle with the central theme: what does it really mean to be normal?.Yes, wow this sounds like an azming show, I am definetly watching it tonight.i'm going to look into bringing someone on who might take care of these tasks.will get back to the group when I hear.Anyone have 2 minutes to talk about blocking and matching as a way to get at a heterogeneous treatment effect.I am spinning my wheels now.s, and also a distance metric relative to a racial category.I think this would be a very straightforward, solid publication.Here is something for the Congress, which we probably already knew existed?You want to change our legal status to domestic partner so we can both apply at UT?But I cook better than I wash dishes, just so we know what the trade-off is.I will let you know what is out there when my librarian gets back with me.I bring forth the data, or at least a demonstration that we can has the data.The question I continue to have is, what we are pointing this variable at.first response, there is a kid at Berkely who has put something together, new data containing district and candidate demographic information for every state legislative general election from 1996-2015".So we would be generating a competing data set, using a different approach.Period.That's what gets published in pol sci journals.Is there a benefit to be had in a dataset (just as a dataset) that is produced in a different fashion, that covers 10% of an existing data set?To me, the data _qua_ data contribution here feels a little slender, especially if someone else already has it.Having the data for our own purposes, to test the HTE, to me feels like a good justification.I wonder because they\u2019ve published a _Stateline_ series, which at least has the ethnicity data that MR_BROWN and MR_ORANGE were thinking about.I\u2019ve been warned that if I scrape the data from the group that I had posted about last week, that the group would shut down campus access and I would be persona non grata.Would this make you sad?Would this violate your rights?Would this give away trade secrets?
