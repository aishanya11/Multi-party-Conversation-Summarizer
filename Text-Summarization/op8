The Traditional costing practices were pressurised by Cooper & Kaplan, (1984) due to the failure of providing detailed and quality information for decision making.Practically, there is a continuum between these two methods in a firm using them (Antos & Brimson, 1999).This paper is structured into three sections.It also expands or criticises the theory provided by Kaplan and Johnson.The third section provides the conclusion.The section presents the literature and evaluation on the publications identifying the ABC techniques and its development.The relevant case study is also presented to provide the evidence of Researches.Initially, it was only a response by American scholars over incorrect standard costing methods.After the initial response, several scholars also provided their opinions.The formal management accounting approach provided by Kaplan & Johnson reveals the resistance from the management control, strategic management and operational control.According to Bhimani (2007), there is rising interest in strategic management accounting (SMA).Under a firm, a SMA tool has the ability to link the strategic & marketing goals with the operational goals.Roslender & Hart (2003) focused on the work of marketing aspects and Brimson (1988) focused over the work of strategic dimensions.These criticisms includes the costly implementation of ABC, greater time utilisation and difficult to define the cost drivers.A recent study by Rodriguez (2010), review thoroughly the existing empirical evidence internationally, about the process of ABC system implementation.â€¢ Analysis of ABC model errors, such as errors in the estimation of model time.For example, the application of the processes of continual improvement to optimise the use of scarce resources of an organisation.Frenosa is a manufacturing company, located in the industrial area, department of Lima Callao.The company operations includes the design, development and production of materials bearings, brake fluid and coolant, rivets tooling to install and auto friction materials parties.The company belongs to the metal industry mechanics and is classified within the ISIC 3430: manufacture of parts and accessories for vehicles and their engines.In July 2000 the company obtained the certified ISO 9002 by BVQI accredited AZ Austria, ANSI Arab, and DAR for manufacture processes of its different product lines.Certification has earned him and strengthen the recognition and confidence to their local customers and from outside.Next, resources are typified into three categories: materials then, direct staff and other resources.If the answer is yes, then charged directly to the product.A Budget can be described as a standard or a plan in financial terms.The budgets are prepared in order to control and measure the actual performance with the planned.ABB is derived from ABC and is related to zero-based budgeting.The development of activity based budgets will help senior executives and managers in exercising control through several ways.Flexibility can be introduced in the labour force such as labour deployed according to the need, hidden cost and waste can be eliminated, considering the least and most expensive activities, places can be identified where spending can be reduced and cost baseline could be established through the introduction of technology and process which limits the efforts requirements in the activity (Vercio, 2011).Strategic control and planning have become essential requirement due to the rising completion and variation in consumer demands.It further provides information regarding enhancement of production process, customer profitability analyses and pricing decision.The ABC has generated enormous enthusiasm in and around its basic ideas.The ABC system is the most developed and expensive attempt done so far to identify and correlation that causes (cost drivers) and activities.It extends the literature that there are many authors that who have argued that in our area we usually determine costs items to the difficulty of finding distribution bases to ensure accurate costing.The Activity-Based Management is not the excellent way to respond to the cost-generating activity, which is true;similarly, an appropriate direction needs not to have an accurate assessment of each functional area and through the resources required to implement it.Many scholars and consultants have never tended to explore the history of thought.However, if they do, avoid leaning their versions of the history.If they do, should be especially careful to avoid claiming that their ideas are new.Influence in decisions relating to the fixed term pricing, product diversification and sale and manufacture thereof.Such simplified ignores other sources of information; other factors influence the pricing and numerous interdependencies and points between products and costs.Apart from a dependable data collection technique, it also trains the employees regarding ABC and activity-based management.More importantly, it also assures the achievement of the project by supporting in constructing a feeling of possession among the employees.Therefore, it is essential that the interviewer who might be a consultant from outside the company or is a member of the project team.It should be well educated and trained over handling various activities of departments including the areas of ABM and ABC.As an example we have the book: Strategic Cost Analysis by Shank (1989) falling in all pointing errors, as attributed characteristics not possessed by ABC shows as a panacea when it is only an instrument further simplifies the job of address-unresolved see all problems and be the great innovation awarded him their eulogies.At the same time some scholars ignore the difficulties presented by such a method, which are neither few nor simple to solve.It is therefore inevitable to refer to the confusion causing the fact that a book with such misunderstanding of what are the costs has dissemination has been achieved e.g.even claims that the traditional methods "as all they do is give distorted information nothing wrong late and cannot thus making decisions.This author goes on to say, From indeed, if top management is unaware of his obsolescence, then it runs a serious risk of wrong decisions and follow product strategies that can be wrong fatal consequences.Apart from that already given in the previous note, this change from the traditional method does not involve talk of a new method.Furthermore, it is also arguable that labour is always considered a fixed cost, as their organisations in which the item is still functional of manufacture and, therefore, it is clearly Variable mind, the typical case would be the.As regards the mathematical model invented by the author of the text, it is only a suggestion to reduce costs, which does not mean, either, which is a cost method., features that do includes the ABC.It is important to elucidate this issue because in the School of Accounting and Administration of the UNAM some teachers have adopted proposals which are considered as costing methods.
