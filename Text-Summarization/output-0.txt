i Hey you know The Haunting of Hill House is an American anthology supernatural horror drama web television series created and directed by Mike Flanagan, and produced by Amblin Television and Paramount Television, for Netflix.The Haunting of Hill House received critical acclaim, particularly for its acting, directing and production values, with many calling it an effective ghost story.Flashing between past and present, a fractured family confronts haunting memories of their old home and the terrifying events that drove them from it.So this series has 10 episodes, each episode exploring the different members of the Crain families.The family must finally confront the ghosts of their past, some of which still lurk in their minds while others may actually be stalking the shadows of Hill House.This series is an amazing watch, I really loved it.I want to talk about the coming elections in the US.Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020, after securing a majority of pledged delegates.I hope Trump loses.Yep, I agree.
