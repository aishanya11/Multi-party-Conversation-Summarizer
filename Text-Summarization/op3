Police in riot gear shot rubber bullets and used pepper spray on demonstrators — who call themselves water protectors — on the shoreline of the Cantapeta Creek, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation here on Wednesday.Schrode had joined others from the camp in solidarity as they prayed on the shoreline.A confrontation erupted after law enforcement dismantled a wooden bridge that demonstrators constructed to access the sacred site."I was shot in point blank range," said Schrode, who says she is shaken but physically will recover."Another water protector was also shot at twice at point blank range, but the rubber bullet hit the water, and not him".In a press release, the Morton County Sheriff's Department said it used "less-than-lethal ammunition to control the situation" when a man threw bottles at officers on the police line and when another charged the police line."Officers also deployed pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the group of protesters who came across the water and camp at officers," the release said.Even as law enforcement warned protesters to leave the area and return to their camp, demonstrators could be heard yelling back at police.According to the Morton County Sheriff's Department public information officer, the police remained there "to prevent criminal trespass on private property"."I was facing the line of officers from across the river and all of a sudden, I felt as if someone swung a mallet with all their might against my lower back.It obliterated me," said Schrode."I turned around and I had no idea what just happened.And there was an officer pointing his gun in my direction from a boat".Morton County called the situation a "standoff" and, in a press release, stated that "protesters involved in this activity are violating numerous federal and state laws".
