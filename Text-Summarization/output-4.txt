However, they suggest that COVID-19 is more deadly than influenza.For example, seasonal influenza typically leads to death in less than 0.Still, the simplicity is attractive.Lets hope we overcome this pandemic soon enough.Wow; that study you linked to is great.Yes!Sweet.In a world where transactions and documents are digitally recorded in one way or another, evidence is out there to aid investigators in the battle against damaging fraudulent schemes.Tell me more.Given the vast amount of data that our investigators need to sift through to find fraudulent patterns, an integrated big data and search architecture emerged as the most feasible approach.Public data, such as providers' information, codes for healthcare procedures, etc.The processed data is then loaded into a search engine.A search-based, graphical user interface is provided to investigators for analysis and evidence documentation.The big data architecture enables the insurance agencys fraud detection effort to be more scalable, faster, and more accurate.Yes, I agree, I'm working on it.I am glad you told us about this.Yes, thats great.It is pretty impressive.Self-learning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.In most cases an nueral network is an adaptive system that changes its structure based on external or internal information that flows through the network.Yep, I like this.They can be used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data.Thanks Alex.
