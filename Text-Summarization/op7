The reasons why accurate referencing is essential for academic work are not immediately apparent, particularly for students new to higher education.’ There are three main reasons for referencing.There are four dimensions to this.However, merely describing existing research, rather than producing their own contributions to the discussion, is inadequate for most academic writers.For example, Barrow and Mosley (2005) combined the fields Human Resources and Brand Management to develop the ‘Employer Brand’ concept.Hence arguments are only as strong as the underlying evidence: arguments relying on questionable sources are – well, questionable.Again, if arguments are badly referenced, readers might not be able to distinguish the writers’ own opinions from their sources.Neville (2007, p.10) emphasises this issue of writing style, and identifies the quest to “find your own voice” as one of the main reasons for referencing.In academic writing, this requires developing an individual style that is neither convoluted nor convivial in tone, but which is clear, open but measured, and is about identifying and using evidence selectively to build and support one’s own arguments.Immanuel Kant said “Science is organized knowledge”.This short quote brilliantly captures the point that the primary mission of science and other disciplines is not to promote individual achievements, but to establish a connected, collective, and recognised body of knowledge.Hence some authors identify this as the principal reason for referencing: “The primary reason for citation [...] is that it encourages and supports the collective construction of academic knowledge” (Walker & Taylor, 2006, pp.29-30).A writer needs to show how his or her work relates to current research and debates in their chosen subject area.9-10), which leads to the next point.However, this practice is not without its critics.186).Thompson calls this “ritualized obedience to the reigning authorities” (2003, p.27).So the important issue here is not about selecting references for their expediency value, but for their enduring quality.This brings us to the next point: credibility.Martin Joseph Routh said in 1878: “You will find it a very good practice always to verify your references, sir!” Correct referencing enables, therefore, the reader to check sources and verify conclusions.The issue of credibility is identified by commentators as a key issue in referencing...] your credibility as an author” (2008, p.177).Neville came to the same conclusion that “to be taken seriously, [a writer] needs to make a transparent presentation of valid evidence” (2007, p.10).References allow the reader to trace the source of the writer’s arguments, consult the original independently and verify whether the writer’s usage of the sources is valid.So what is the point of referencing?
