Given the vast amount of data that our investigators need to sift through to find fraudulent patterns, an integrated big data and search architecture emerged as the most feasible approach.Public data, such as providers' information, codes for healthcare procedures, etc., is aggregated and processed through the big data framework, which performs massive denormalization to distribute data into multiple tables and fields.The processed data is then loaded into a search engine.
